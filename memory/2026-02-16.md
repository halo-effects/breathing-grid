# 2026-02-16 — Daily Notes

## Trading Bot
- Bot ran healthy all day, no downtime
- Regime cycling: ACCUMULATION → MILD_TREND → TRENDING → RANGING throughout the day
- Short side very productive: closed deals #66-#71 (6 deals), realized ~$1.02
- Long #59 stuck with 2 SOs all day, waiting for bounce
- HYPE ranged ~$29.77–$30.58
- Capital at $326.48
- API ping failure was transient (1/3), self-recovered
- Trend flipped bearish briefly (~7:39 AM), allocations adjusted to 40/60

## Telegram Delivery Issue
- Brett's earlier messages (ROI question at 9:05, volatility comment at 8:18) didn't trigger responses on his end
- Messages were received by me and I responded, but Brett didn't see replies until ~10:28
- Tested TG bot token directly — works fine (sent test ping, message_id 940)
- Likely gateway or delivery delay, not bot token issue

## Repo Rename: breathing-grid → adaptive-intelligence-trading
- Renamed via GitHub settings UI in browser
- Updated: git remote, sync_dashboard.ps1 (repo URL), product-overview.html (dashboard link), MEMORY.md
- Memory diary files left as historical records
- New URLs:
  - Repo: github.com/halo-effects/adaptive-intelligence-trading
  - Product page: halo-effects.github.io/adaptive-intelligence-trading/
  - Dashboard: halo-effects.github.io/adaptive-intelligence-trading/dashboard.html
- GitHub auto-redirects old /breathing-grid URLs temporarily

## Coin Scanner
- 4h cron job ran twice, slow but normal (~279 pairs with maturity checks)

## Dashboard Updates
- Added ticker symbol display for multi-coin readiness (sub-agent task):
  - Trade History table: Symbol column after Time
  - Open Orders table: Symbol column
  - Active Trades panels: "LONG HYPE #59" format
  - Bottom bar: Trading stat showing active symbol(s)
- All changes pushed to GitHub

## Trading Bot (afternoon update)
- Long #59 finally closed around 4 PM! HYPE pushed to $31.16
- Now on Long #73 (0 SOs), Short #72 (3 SOs)
- Price range expanded: ~$29.77–$31.16 for the day
- DISTRIBUTION regime appeared (allocation 30/70 L/S) — first time seeing this regime

## Plans & Pricing Page — Built ~4:30 PM
- Created `docs/pricing.html` — full SaaS-style pricing page
- 5 tiers: Starter $500, Trader $1K, Pro $2.5K (featured), Elite $5K, Whale $10K
- Max capital caps: $5K / $10K / $25K / $50K / $100K
- Global capacity pool: $2.5M total, visual meter
- Breakeven calculator: ~29 days at 0.35% daily ROI for all tiers
- Comprehensive FAQ with accordion (licensing, technical, trading, capital, payments)
- CTA buttons placeholder (crypto payments coming later)
- Added "Pricing" nav link to index.html header
- Live: halo-effects.github.io/adaptive-intelligence-trading/pricing.html

## Risk Profiles Spec — Created ~6:50 PM
- Formal product spec: `projects/ait-product/risk-profiles-spec.md`
- Three profiles: Low (current settings), Medium (2-3× leverage), High (5-10× leverage)
- Capital allocation system: users split capital % across profiles (default 100% Low)
- Presets: Conservative (100/0/0), Balanced (60/30/10), Aggressive (30/40/30), Custom
- Auto-guardrails: Medium→Low at 30% DD, High→Medium at 50% DD, High→Low at 60% DD
- Virtual sub-accounts per profile, shared exchange account
- All tiers get all profiles (feature, not upsell)
- Key differentiator: portfolio theory applied to bot trading
- Brett's idea — originated as thought experiment about low/medium/high risk settings

## Risk Profiles Marketing Page — Created ~7 PM
- Created `docs/risk-profiles.html` — full product marketing page with interactive mock UI
- Interactive allocation sliders (Low/Medium/High), preset buttons, live-updating donut chart
- Mock dashboard cards showing per-profile P&L tracking
- Parameter comparison table, risk amplifier visualization, guardrails waterfall
- ROI projections table, competitive edge section, FAQ accordion
- "Coming Soon" badge — feature not yet built, page is marketing/preview
- Nav updated across all 3 pages (index, pricing, risk-profiles)
- Live: halo-effects.github.io/adaptive-intelligence-trading/risk-profiles.html

## Capital Utilization Fix — ~5:30 PM
- Dashboard "Pending" showed $0 because exchange available_balance doesn't account for unfilled limit orders
- Fixed: now calculates pending from unfilled SO grid (base_order × so_vol_mult^n per pending SO)
- Active = filled positions, Pending = would-be cost if all SOs fill, Reserve = truly available

## Brett Notes
- Asked about TRENDING regime behavior — confirmed all regimes trade except EXTREME
- Noticed capital utilization dropped, aware long #59 is tying up capital
- Requested ticker symbol on dashboard for multi-coin readiness
- Requested Plans & Pricing page based on capital cap tiers from API spec
- Mentioned possibly doing ShadowQuery work later if he has time (didn't happen)
